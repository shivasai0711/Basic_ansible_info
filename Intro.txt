Step 1: What is Ansible?
Ansible is an automation tool used to manage and configure servers.
 It helps automate repetitive tasks, like installing software, 
 configuring settings, and deploying applications,
  so you can efficiently manage many servers at once.

Step 2: How Ansible Works
Ansible uses a control node to manage managed 
nodes (servers or machines you want to configure).
 It’s agentless, meaning you don’t need to install anything on
  the managed nodes. Ansible connects over SSH (for Linux) or
   WinRM (for Windows) to send instructions from the control node.

Step 3: Key Terms to Know

Playbooks: The main files where you define what Ansible should do.
 Written in YAML, playbooks list tasks for Ansible to execute.

Tasks: Each action within a playbook (e.g., install software, create a file).

Inventory: A list of servers you want Ansible to manage, 
organized by IP addresses or hostnames.

Modules: Reusable scripts for specific tasks. For example, 
the apt module installs packages on Debian-based systems, 
while yum does so on Red Hat-based systems.

Roles: A way to organize playbooks into reusable, modular units.

Step 4: Installing Ansible

If you're using a Linux system, here’s how you can install Ansible:

Update your system:

bash

sudo apt update  # For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum update  # For RHEL/CentOS
Install Ansible:

bash

sudo apt install ansible  # For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install ansible  # For RHEL/CentOS
Verify Installation:

bash

ansible --version
Step 5: Setting Up Your First Inventory
The inventory file tells Ansible which servers to manage.
 You can create a basic inventory file (inventory.ini) like this:

ini

[webservers]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11

[dbservers]
192.168.1.20
Step 6: Running Your First Command
Try running a simple command to test connectivity. 
Save the inventory file, then use Ansible to check if it 
Scan reach your servers:

bash

ansible all -i inventory.ini -m ping
Explanation:
all: Targets all servers in the inventory.
-i inventory.ini: Specifies the inventory file.
-m ping: Uses the ping module to check if the connection works.

Step 7: Writing Your First Playbook 

A playbook is a YAML file where you define tasks for Ansible
 to perform on managed nodes. Let’s create a simple playbook
  to install nginx on a group of servers.

Create a Playbook File: Create a file named install_nginx.yml.

Define the Playbook Structure: Playbooks are written in YAML format,
 and they follow a specific structure. Here’s a basic playbook to install nginx:

yaml

---
- name: Install NGINX on web servers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes  # Allows the playbook to run as root

  tasks:
    - name: Install NGINX
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

Explanation:
name: A description of the playbook.
hosts: Specifies which servers to target (webservers,
 which you defined in your inventory).
become: yes: Runs the tasks with elevated privileges (useful
 for tasks requiring root access).
tasks: Lists the tasks for Ansible to perform.
apt: The Ansible module used to manage packages 
 on Debian-based systems (use yum for RHEL-based systems).
Run the Playbook:

Now, use the ansible-playbook command to execute the playbook:

bash

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_nginx.yml

Explanation:
-i inventory.ini: Specifies the inventory file.
install_nginx.yml: The playbook you want to run.

Step 8: Understanding Modules

Modules are the building blocks of Ansible tasks.
 The playbook above used the apt module to install nginx. 
 Here’s a quick overview of some common Ansible modules:

Package Management:

apt: For managing packages on Debian/Ubuntu.
yum: For managing packages on RHEL/CentOS.
Service Management:

service: For starting, stopping, and restarting services.
File Management:

copy: Copies files to managed nodes.
file: Manages file permissions, ownership, and links.

Step 9: Adding More Tasks to Your Playbook
Let’s expand the playbook to start nginx after installation and enable 
it to start on boot:

yaml

---
- name: Install and start NGINX on web servers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install NGINX
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start NGINX service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
Explanation:
service: This module manages services. Here, it ensures nginx is started 
and enabled at boot.

Step 10: Using Variables
Variables make playbooks flexible and reusable. 
Here’s how to use a variable for the package name:

Define Variables in the Playbook:

yaml

---
- name: Install and start a web server
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  vars:
    web_package: nginx

  tasks:
    - name: Install web server
      apt:
        name: "{{ web_package }}"
        state: present

    - name: Start web server service
      service:
        name: "{{ web_package }}"
        state: started
        enabled: yes
Explanation:
vars: This section defines variables, like web_package here.
{{ web_package }}: Jinja2 syntax for using variables in tasks.
 It replaces {{ web_package }} with the actual value defined in vars.
